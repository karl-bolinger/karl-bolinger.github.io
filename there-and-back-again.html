<h1>Fabricated Perceptions</h1>
<p>A mockup is a conceptual tool that is used especially in web development. It is basically an early draft of a website or web application.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to see the world and to understand the ‘whole’ (the planet). We have to be willing to see from multiple perspectives. My work offers a way to see the landscape differently. I am working to give the viewer a different way to look at the landscape and to begin to consider self, role, cause and effect, depth, understanding, curiosity and beauty.</p>
    <p>This is where I’ve begun to focus on specific details such as the invisible and visible features, elemental forces, the inhabitants, neglected landscapes, interstitial spaces, and landscapes of devastation and beauty.</p>
    <p>My technique and choice of materials reflect my observations of our relationship as well as my interaction towards the landscape. My approach varies from a tedious and labor-intensive process to an intuitive, gestural approach. These two approaches can be and are places of meditation for me but also represent ‘our’ relationship as whole with the landscape.</p>
    <p>My work is a reconstruction or facsimile of visual information collected then represented through models made by actual landscape materials such as rocks, clay, and grass or by faux versions used by architects or model train enthusiasts.</p>
    <p>Icons who have commented on the beauty, form and systems of landscape are Maya Lin, Tara Donavan, Stacy Levy, Meg Webster, and Blaine De St. Croix. Mark Dion specifically influences me with his method of personal science and archeology, as well as his way of teaching the viewer. Architecture, landscape architecture and Japanese design are other disciplines that explore and create these same places of reflection, meditation, and education. These disciplines, practitioners, and the idea that one voice or many small ones can impact the ‘whole’, leaves me with the responsibility and obligation to share with others.</p>

    <p>There were specifications I was to meet which were:</p>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li>All text is formatted identically to the mockup. Do not use break <code> &lt;br&gt;</code>tags for this project. Create the desired separation with paragraph tags <code>&lt;p&gt; text &lt;p&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>The image’s source is the correct <code>URL</code> and all links in the article are correct.</li>

      <p>I have learned about lists and sourcing images. Most of it has been fairly simple except sourcing the image correctly. Took me 10 minutes to understand what was happening. For the mockups I saw that the files were adapted from actual web pages. So I went to the page and inspected it to see how it was formatted in html then used MDN to understand the elements used and imitated the formatting. I have not yet had the need to leverage the community, peers or mentors for assistance. The only thing I am not sure on is whether or not the formatting of my files are correct and legible. It has not been ‘difficult’ so far.</p>
